# Privacy Policy for Simple Contrast Analyzer
### Last Updated: July 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Simple Contrast Analyzer (the "Extension"), developed by Dizaraj Dey, handles your information. This policy applies to the Simple Contrast Analyzer Chrome Extension.

**1. No Data Collection** 

We believe in privacy by design. The Simple Contrast Analyzer extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or any other data from you or your device.

**2. How the Extension Works**

All the functionality of the Simple Contrast Analyzer happens locally on your computer.

* **Color Analysis:** When you use the eyedropper tool or input a hex code, the color information is processed directly within your browser. This data is only used to calculate the contrast ratio and is discarded as soon as you close the extension popup.

* **No Tracking:** The extension does not use cookies, analytics, or any other tracking technologies. We do not monitor how you use the extension.

**3. Permissions**

The extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

* `storage` : The permission is required solely to enable the eyedropper functionality, which allows you to pick a color and save from the active webpage. The extension does not read or interact with any other content on the page.

**4. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

**5. Contact Us**
